I am an energetic self-starter with the ambition to grow further as a Full Stack Junior Developer. Combining my passion for technology, background of over four years of tech experience and five years building my own small business which turned over $6 mil at its peak.

I thrive in an ambiguous environment, always maintaining a student mentality and striving to be a value-added team member in any company I join.

I am an energetic self-starter with the ambition to grow further as a Full Stack Junior Developer. Combining my passion for technology, and background with over four years of tech experience and five years building my own company which turned over $6 mil at its peak. 

I thrive in an ambiguous environment, always maintaining a student mentality and striving to be a value-added team member in any company I join.
